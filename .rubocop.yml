# Rubocop, we're buddies and all, but we're going to have to disagree on the following -

# Disable ABC, it's not needed in chef

# Disable requirement of "encoding" headers on files
Encoding:
  Enabled: false

# Increase line length, we're not on VT220s anymore

# is a bit too low.
MethodLength:
  Max: 40

# Favor explicit over implicit code: don't complain of "redundant returns"
RedundantReturn:
  Enabled: false

# Don't complain about if/unless modifiers. The merit of this is debatable
# and it will likely require building of over-length lines.
IfUnlessModifier:
  Enabled: false

# Raise allowed CyclomaticComplexity to 10.
CyclomaticComplexity:
  Max: 10

# Disable Single Space before first arg
SpaceBeforeFirstArg:
  Enabled: false
